To calculation the crystal formfactor different steps have to be done

1.  check in all scripts and dm.in and ge.X.in if the same number of k-points is set
2.  run creation.sh
    It will create a lot of folders, with dm.in, job.pbs and ge.X.in in them.
    The script adds the corresponding k_value in dm.in for every folder
3.  Run multijob.sh
    It will send the jobs to Tesla
4.  If all jobs are finish run sum.sh
    Which creates the C.dat containing the formfactor
